## Scope & intent

- Current state: a **prototype** that simulates measurement devices and can store patient check-ins locally and optionally to Supabase.
- Goal: provide enough clarity that a new engineer, a product owner, or hospital staff can understand the system, its limitations, and the path to production readiness.

## How to read diagrams

Diagrams are written in **Mermaid** so they render in GitHub/VS Code previews.
See: [UML & diagrams](technical/UML.md).
